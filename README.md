# Computational-Thinking-MIT

**Course Website**: [Introduction to Computational Thinking Fall23](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall23/)

This is homework I finish when self-learning MIT Computational Thinking

The programming lanuage this course uses is [Julia](https://julialang.org/), which is really interesting to learn and use in my opinion.

Open the `.jl` file with [Pluto Notebook](https://plutojl.org/).
